# Mooshak Server
Simple and easy-to-manage ssh container for TCP (and [UDP](https://github.com/ambrop72/badvpn)) tunneling.

## Setup

To setup a mooshak server you will need `git`, `docker` and `docker compose` (comes with docker itself in latest versions) installed.


Go to directory of your choice and clone the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mooshak-vpn/mooshak-server
```

Next, go to newly cloned `mooshak-server` directory 

```shell
cd mooshak-server  # cloned directory
```

After that, create required docker volume and networks, then you can start `mooshak-server` by runing the docker compose:


```shell
# Network and volume:
docker volume create mooshak_sshd
docker network create mooshak

# Running:
docker compose up -d  # or: docker-compose up -d
```

Congradulations! You have mooshak ready to be used. The SSH server will be available on port `2255`, and websocket tunnel will be available on port `3344`.

To stop the mooshak server go to the same directory and then use:

```shell
docker compose down
```

## Managing users

The `mooshak` container has scripts installed to help you add or remove users.

First you need to find the running container:

```shell
docker ps
```

Example output:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                   NAMES
ac057f82ebd8   mooshak-vpn-wstunnel  "/bin/sh -c '/wstunnâ€¦"   3 seconds ago   Up 2 seconds   0.0.0.0:3344->80/tcp, :::3344->80/tcp   mooshak-vpn-wstunnel
64f256e4f023   mooshak-vpn-mooshak   "/entrypoint.sh"         3 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   0.0.0.0:2255->22/tcp, :::2255->22/tcp   mooshak-vpn-sshd

```

The container ID we are looking for is `64f256e4f023` in this example, with image name `mooshak-vpn-sshd`.

To add a new user (or update their password) use:

```shell
$ docker exec mooshak-vpn-sshd ./adduser.sh /adduser.sh <username> <password>

# Eaxmple valid output >  New password: Retype new password: passwd: password updated successfully
```

To remove a user (and terminate their open session) use:

```shell
$ docker exec <COONTAINER ID HERE> ./deleteuser.sh <username>

# Example valid output:
# Looking for files to backup/remove ...
# Removing files ...
# Removing user `sep' ...
# Warning: group `nogroup' has no more members.
# Done.
```



## Run behind Nginx - Websocket

You can configure your Nginx setup to forward websocket connections to websocket port listened by Mooshak WsTunnel (`3344`).

Here is a sample path configuration to add to your Nginx setup:

```
location /mooshak {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3344;
        proxy_http_version  1.1;
        proxy_set_header    Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header    Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header    Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

        proxy_connect_timeout       10m;
        proxy_send_timeout          10m;
        proxy_read_timeout          90m;
        send_timeout                10m;
}
```

Reload your Nginx service and you are good to go.


## Changing ports and max clients

To change ports, take a look at `docker-compose.yaml` file. The environment variable `UDPG_MAX_CLIENTS` (default to `20`) sets how many users can use `udpgw` at same time. Rest of them won't be able to use udp tunneling.
